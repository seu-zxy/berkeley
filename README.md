Student starter code for Fall 2019 labs

# berkely
This is the backup for my projects, labs, homework done during 19fall in cs61c and cs61b.( The original repository is missing due to the loss of bmail after the semester)
Almost all work has been done with high scores.

Temporary public for graduate application during 2020.12.2 --2021.4.15

If berkeley faculty worries about students cheating by seeing this code, you can contact me. I will make this private again.
