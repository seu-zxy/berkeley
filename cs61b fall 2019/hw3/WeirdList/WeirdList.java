     * You should not add any methods to WeirdList, but you will need
     * to add private fields (e.g. head).

     * But that's not all!

     * You will need to create at least one additional class for WeirdList
     * to work. This is because you are forbidden to use any of the
     * following in ANY of the code for HW3:
     *       if, switch, while, for, do, try, or the ?: operator.

     * If you'd like an obtuse hint, scroll to the very bottom of this
     * file.

     * You can create this hypothetical class (or classes) in separate
     * files like you usually do, or if you're feeling bold you can
     * actually stick them INSIDE of this class. Yes, nested classes
     * are a thing in Java.

     * As an example:
     * class Garden {
     *     private static class Potato {
     *        int n;
     *        public Potato(int nval) {
     *           n = nval;
     *        }
     *     }
     * }
     * You are NOT required to do this, just an extra thing you can
     * do if you want to avoid making a separate .java file. */

}

/*
 * Hint: The first non-trivial thing you'll probably do to WeirdList
 * is to fix the EMPTY static variable so that it points at something
 * useful. */
