Gitlet Design Document
----------------------
about head:  need a int to save the latest committed hash code
staged area:
give it a folder in git
save blob and its title(as a format of what? hashcode to save is fine
commit area:really save all the hash code about commit

init: have a commit initialed pointed to null(all file null)
add: if new add to staged area, if not just compare to the now header's file,if changed add or do nothing
commit: clone parent then do the change as the staged area. remember to clear the staged space

Classes and Data Structures
---------------------------
to save all the commit version, we may use arraylist
for branch:tree is better , use it find to get the version we want to get to
current and we have tracked: comparison : need to save the name, it is used to track the file
